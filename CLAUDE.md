# ClawHub — Project Rules

## Convex Performance Rules

- For public listing/browse pages, use `ConvexHttpClient.query()` (one-shot fetch),
  not `useQuery`/`usePaginatedQuery` (reactive subscription). Reserve reactive
  queries for data the user needs to see update in real time.
- Denormalize hot read paths into a single lightweight "digest" table. Every
  `ctx.db.get()` join adds a table to the reactive invalidation scope.
- When a `skillSearchDigest` row is available, use `digestToOwnerInfo(digest)`
  to resolve owner data. NEVER call `ctx.db.get(ownerUserId)` when digest
  owner fields (`ownerHandle`, `ownerName`, `ownerDisplayName`, `ownerImage`)
  are already present. Reading from `users` adds the entire table to the
  reactive read set and wastes bandwidth.
- Use `convex-helpers` Triggers to sync denormalized tables automatically.
  Always add change detection — skip the write if no fields actually changed.
- Use compound indexes instead of JS filtering. If you're filtering docs after
  the query, you're scanning documents you'll throw away.
- For search results scored by computed values (vector + lexical + popularity),
  fetch all results once and paginate client-side. Don't re-run the full search
  pipeline on "load more."
- Backfills on reactively-subscribed tables need `delayMs` between batches.
- Mutations that read >8 MB should use the Action → Query → Mutation pattern
  to split reads across transactions.

## Convex Conventions

- All mutations import from `convex/functions.ts` (not `convex/_generated/server`)
  to get trigger wrapping. Type imports still come from `convex/_generated/server`.
- NEVER use `--typecheck=disable` on `npx convex deploy`.
- Use `npx convex dev --once` to push functions once (not long-running watcher).

## Testing

- Tests use `._handler` to call mutation handlers directly with mock `db` objects.
- Mock `db` objects MUST include `normalizeId: vi.fn()` for trigger wrapper compatibility.
